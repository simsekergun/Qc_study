# Qc_study
Google Colab Edition of the Qc prediction study shared at https://github.com/simsekergun/Qc_Prediction

- We predict the quality factor of the microrign resonators at high frequencies based on those resonators' quality factors at the lower frequencies using three different neural networks: fully-connected neural network (FCNN), recurrent neuural network (RNN), and attention mechanism.
- We treat the prediction problem either as an interpolation (train-test data split is done randomly) or an extrapolation problem (test data includes features beyond the training data).
- The original Qc dataset[https://github.com/simsekergun/Qc_datasets_functions] is generated by Gregory Moille.
- The python code is developed by Masoud Soroush and edited by Ergun Simsek. Attention.py includes functions written by Edward Raff as well.
